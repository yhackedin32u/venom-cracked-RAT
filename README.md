Cracked Venom RAT" (Remote Access Trojan) refers to an illegally modified version of the Venom RAT malware that bypasses payment or licensing requirements. Venom RAT itself is a powerful remote administration tool often used maliciously to gain unauthorized control over a victimâ€™s computer. A cracked version would likely have altered code, making it easier for cybercriminals to distribute, install, and execute without permission. This modified RAT provides access to the infected system, enabling spying on users, stealing credentials, deploying other malware, and disrupting system functions, while evading detection from antivirus software.
